# Module 21 Challenge

## Overview of Project
This projects creates a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted by using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

This crowdsale contract manages the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KA, or KaseiCoin tokens. The contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

## Requirements

* Remix IDE - The remix IDE can be access here: https://remix.ethereum.org
* Solidity - Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern   the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.
* MetaMask - A crypto wallet & gateway to blockchain apps
* Ganache - Ganache is a personal blockchain for rapid Ethereum distributed application development. 
* OpenZeppelin - OpenZeppelin is a set of vetted smart contracts. It helps you put precautionary security measures in place for your Web3 apps.
