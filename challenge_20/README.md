# Module 20 Challenge

## Overview of Project
This project automates the creation of joint savings accounts, using a Solidity smart contract accepting two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account using ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## Requirements
This project uses Solidity 0.5.0 and the Remix IDE which can be accessed via this link: [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

You many find it helpful to use a Ethereum Unit Converter located here: [Converter](https://eth-converter.com)
